# Guess-a-number-game
Guess a number game is a kind of retrodesign that was inspired by the old 80s game.Guess the number game was design with HTML5,CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT.
The goal of this game project is to simply guess a secret number between 1 and 20.
I started this project by creating a variable called 'SecretNumber' which generate a random Secret number between 1 and 20.Then i added a 'check' button with the aid of the
.addEventListener in Javascript in which we created an input form that when we input a guesss value inside the form and click on the 'check' button it will tells us where the
'guess is too high' or'guess too low' or 'Correct Number!' or 'No Number'.I implemented this using the if and else if  statement in Javascript.I also implemented the 'Score' button
in which the score is 20 so if the user guess a number and keeps checking it with the 'check' button the score will keep reducing by 1,Then whem it score get to 0,It will
give a message that 'You lost the game'.I also implemented the 'again' button  and also 'Highscore'which keep the value of the highscore.So if the user guess the random number 
correctly,the backGroundColor will change to Green and give a message 'Correct Number!'.
This is also one of the projects I made in Jonas Schmedtmann(The Complete Javascript Course 2022:From Zero to Experts)
